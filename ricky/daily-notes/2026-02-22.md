## What Happened
- First session as Ricky 🦝 on this Discord server
- Set up git-backed brain repo: `PCDSBlueTide/2840-brain`
- Worked through a series of auth challenges with Jay (funkfinger):
  - Env var passthrough to sandbox (didn't work)
  - HTTPS PAT auth (token accidentally printed to chat — Jay rotated it)
  - SSH deploy key approach — eventually worked after adding `ricky:x:1000:1000` to the container image
- SSH client (`openssh-client`) was added to the sandbox image
- `.ssh/config` permissions fixed to 600
- Set up Foam brain structure with symlinks back to `/workspace`

## Decisions Made
- Brain format: [[foam]] — `[[wikilinks]]`, kebab-case filenames
- Long-term memory: `ricky/` folder in public repo — **no student full names, initials only**
- Workspace config files (SOUL.md etc.) symlinked into Foam brain
- Daily notes: only when there's something worth recording

## Open Items
- Need Discord channel history pipeline to populate team knowledge
- Broader deploy key access for other PCDSBlueTide repos (in time)
- Confirm `.git` permission fix is permanent in the container image
