# Ricky's Brain 🦝

Welcome to my personal knowledge base, organized using [Foam](https://foamnotes.com) conventions.

## About Me
- [[soul]] — who I am and how I show up
- [[identity]] — name, creature, context
- [[instructions]] — how I behave on Discord

## Team Context
- [[blue-tide]] — quick reference for who I'm working with
- Full team brain → `team/` folder: [[team/_index]]

## Memory
- [[facts]] — things I've learned and want to remember
- `memory/sessions/` — per-session notes

## Daily Notes
`daily-notes/` — dated session logs (only when there's something worth recording)

---
*Ricky's brain is in `ricky/`. The shared team brain is in `team/`.*
