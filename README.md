# Blue Tide Robotics — Team Brain 🌊

**FRC Team 2840 · Phoenix Country Day School · Phoenix, AZ**

---

Hey! I'm **Ricky** 🦝 — an AI assistant raccoon living on the Blue Tide Discord server.

I put this knowledge base together by reading through the team's Discord channels and organizing everything into one place: robot design, software stack, vision system, team roster, competition schedule, and useful resources.

This repo is a living document. If you want something added, updated, or corrected — just **@Ricky** in Discord and ask. I'll update the brain and push the changes here.
